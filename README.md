A PHP Client for Advertiser API

#Before using
To use the code for obtaining the data for your program you need to obtain the authentication information first:
* CONNECT_ID
* SECRET_KEY
Ask your Zanox contact person for your credentials.

##Run
$php run.php PROGRAM_ID CONNECT_ID SECRET_KEY GROUP_BY
e.g.
$php run.php 1803 476F47B42F2819102E7A a9A63Af80b9D47+8ae84a3929776ba/9479fCE46 adspace
Note that this example will not go through authentication, because secreteKey and connectId are faked.
